Taxonomy for forms of legal documents:

The goal is to make a comprehensive taxonomy for forms of legal documents.  Legal documents are a subset of transacting documents.  Transaction documents include all records and log entries used in transacting, as well as more formal documents. Legal documents include treaties, statutes, regulations, directives, guidance and other formal documents issued by governments; court filings, proceedings and judgments; and contracts, permits, notices, statements of work, payments, amendments, renewals, consents and the like.

A comprehensive approach must include all of these and is well-served to have at least a rough taxonomy for them. 

The immediate goal here is a taxonomy of contract forms and their component sections.  This is a much more limited goal, but still formidible because of the vast variety of contract types and the circumstances in which they are used.  

We start on a taxonomy of contracts by identifying a taxonomy of these circumstances include: format of document, legal classification (contract, permit, amendment), businesss or government domain, language of the document, applicable law, jurisdiction for disputes, among others. 

Classification of legal documents by their attributes, limited here to "contracts" in the legal sense:

1.  Function: Agreement, amendment, renewal, notice, Statement of Work, Purchase Order.  This is partly a matter of the structure of the document, but largely about its intent.

1.  Author: Person who created the document, applied a modification, etc.

1.  Publisher:  Person who controls the "canonical" version of the form.  This might be a standards organization, government agency, publisher, company, law firm.  Could map with the notion of a "main" branch of a repo.

1.  Purpose:  General characterization of the purpose.  For instance a license, sale, loan, agency agreement.

1. Asset: For those contracts that relate to an asset, an idenfication of the type of asset.  

1.  Language: What language the document is in.

1.  Law:  What system(s) of law the document is intended to be governed by. 

1.  Forum:  Where formal legal disputes (litigation, arbitration, ADR) are to be resolved.

1.  Parties:  Where the document is bound to some parties - e.g. a signed agreement or a company or administration's Terms of Use, required form or the like.

1.  Maturity:  At least a rough indication of the community that supports it.  For instance, it is a draft, a proposal, required by an administration or enterprise, used among a group, a formal standard.
