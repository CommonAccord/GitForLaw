Taxonomy for forms of legal documents:

See also [https://github.com/CommonAccord/GitForLaw/tree/master/Model/Submission]

The goal is to make a comprehensive taxonomy for forms of legal documents.  Legal documents are a subset of transacting documents.  Transaction documents include all records and log entries used in transacting, as well as more formal documents. Legal documents include treaties, statutes, regulations, directives, guidance and other formal documents issued by governments; court filings, proceedings and judgments; and contracts, permits, notices, statements of work, payments, amendments, renewals, consents and the like.

A comprehensive approach must include all of these and is well-served to have at least a rough taxonomy for them. 

The immediate goal here is a taxonomy of contract forms and their component sections.  This is a much more limited goal, but still formidible because of the vast variety of contract types and the circumstances in which they are used.  

We start on this simply, by inviting people to contribute links to them, with a few objective data points. 

This is a draft list of suggested data points for each contribution.  The only mandatory items are the URL for the document and the name of the Submitter, but the rest are helpful and hopefully easy in most circumstances.  Where the language is other than English, please feel free to use that language, and let us know of obstacles:

1. A Unique Name for the form:  This may be composed of the name of the publisher, the document name, and a version number or date.

1. Location:  A URL or similar.

1. Submitter: the person submitting the link.

1.  Function: Agreement, amendment, renewal, notice, Statement of Work, Purchase Order.  This is partly a matter of the structure of the document, but largely about its intent.

1.  Author: Person who created the document, applied a modification, etc.

1.  Publisher:  Person who controls the "canonical" version of the form.  This might be a standards organization, government agency, publisher, company, law firm.  Could map with the notion of a "main" branch of a repo.

1.  Purpose:  General characterization of the purpose.  For instance a license, sale, loan, agency agreement.

1. Asset: For those contracts that relate to an asset, an idenfication of the type of asset.  

1.  Language: What language the document is in.

1.  Law:  What system(s) of law the document is intended to be governed by. 

1.  Forum:  Where formal legal disputes (litigation, arbitration, ADR) are to be resolved.

1.  Parties:  Where the document is bound to some parties - e.g. a signed agreement or a company or administration's Terms of Use, required form or the like.

1.  Maturity:  At least a rough indication of the community that supports it.  For instance, it is a draft, a proposal, required by an administration or enterprise, used among a group, a formal standard.

1.  Summary:  A short summary of the form.
