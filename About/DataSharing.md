=Short Description of a Comprehensive Approach to Contracting, Data Management, Decentralization and Governance:

The thesis is that pursuing this Sage initiative that advocates a “modular” (templated) approach to data sharing agreements would lead to radical improvement of law, data management, governance, even automation.

Modularalizing data sharing agreements by templating them is entirely doable, and will show that all other legal documents can also be modularized and templated.

Agreements of this type pass along ontologies for activities under them, including the interactions of data access, notices, receipts and the like.

All of these records can be organized into a graph, with each record linked to _all_ of its dependencies, including prior steps, text, algorithms and computing operating environments.

All dependencies can be made overridable - just like all other elements of the records (prototype inheritance).

Overriding can permit people “at the edge” to use the system as they wish, adapting it, extending, bending it to their own purposes and situations, running it locally, while maintaining as much interoperability as they wish.

Keeping track of adaptations contributed back into shared repositories can be combined with pattern-recognition to i) improve the solution ii) identify alternatives and variations to users and iii) teach the machine about human relationships and governance.  (HumanCompatible.ai)
